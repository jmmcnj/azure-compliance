        AU-2 - Audit Events
        All Azure events are monitored through Operations Management Suite (OMS).
        This is implemented with our OMS monitoring agents that are applied to every virtual machine
        in the environment.
        A verification step can be done by confirming the existence
        of the OMS agent on each machine with InSpec.

        SC-1 - System and Communications Protection Policy and Procedures
        This text describes how our organization is meeting the requirements for the
        Security Controls policy, and also references a more complete description at
        the referenced document at
        https://github.com/AppliedIS/azure-blueprint/wiki/NIST-800-53-rev4-Controls
        Since the SC-1 `control` is to document and disseminate a policy on
        Security Controls
        this narrative suffices to provide that control. A verification step could be something
        that checks that the referenced policy is no more than 365 days old.

        SC-7 - Boundary protection
        Boundary protection is provided, in Azure, with Security Groups that do not allow
        ingress except to port 443 and access through the Host Bastion environment
        Verification: No security groups allow 0.0.0.0 inbound except ones named 'elb.*' can
        allowed port 443 to 0.0.0.0 (testing with InspecAws)
