    - text: |
        This text describes how our organization is meeting the requirements for the
        Audit policy, and also references a more complete description at ./AU_policy/README.md
        Since the AU-1 `control` is to document and disseminate a policy on Audit and Accountability, then
        this narrative suffices to provide that control. A verification step could be something
        that checks that the referenced policy is no more than 365 days old.
