# Freedonia website SSP introduction

These documents constitute the System Security Plan for the Freedonia "Hello World" application (under development). The contents of this file, (from `markdowns/README.md`) are rendered to appear as the introduction of the SSP by Masonry and GitBook.

A Freedonia SSP (as well as one for USA) comprises:
* Narrative: A narrative description (from `markdowns/README.md` and
  other content under `markdowns/docs`
* Standards: A description of standards and relevant controls (generated from _components_ and _dependencies/systems_ references in the `opencontrol.yaml`)
* Components: Links to details of the components (also generated from `opencontrol.yaml`)

While a README.md may be sufficient to provide a narrative introduction
for an SSP, it's likely you'll need to go into more depth. This Freedonia SSP
project demonstrates the narrative by placing content and related images in `markdowns/docs`

This SSP is intended to demonstrate the _process_, not the _content_ for an SSP built with OpenControl and ComplianceMasonry. For an example of the content: https://github.com/18F/cg-compliance and resulting site at https://compliance.cloud.gov.
