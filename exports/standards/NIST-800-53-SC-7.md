##Boundary Protection

#### Azure Implementation
SC-7 - Boundary protection
Boundary protection is provided, in Azure, with Security Groups that do not allow
ingress except to port 443 and access through the Host Bastion environment
Verification: No security groups allow 0.0.0.0 inbound except ones named 'elb.*' can
allowed port 443 to 0.0.0.0 (testing with InspecAws)
