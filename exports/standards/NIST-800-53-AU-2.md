#### Azure Implementation
AU-2 - Audit Events
All Azure events are monitored through Operations Management Suite (OMS).
This is implemented with our OMS monitoring agents that are applied to every virtual machine
in the environment.
A verification step can be done by confirming the existence
of the OMS agent on each machine with InSpec.
