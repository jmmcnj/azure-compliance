#### Azure Implementation
SC-1 - System and Communications Protection Policy and Procedures
This text describes how our organization is meeting the requirements for the
Security Controls policy, and also references a more complete description at
the referenced document at
https://github.com/AppliedIS/azure-blueprint/wiki/NIST-800-53-rev4-Controls
Since the SC-1 `control` is to document and disseminate a policy on
Security Controls
this narrative suffices to provide that control. A verification step could be something
that checks that the referenced policy is no more than 365 days old.
